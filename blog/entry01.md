# Entry 1 Deciding my topic (Cooking)
##### 10/23/23

## Choosing the topic

The topic I decided on is cooking because I been cooking for a few years now and I think it is kind of fun cooking unless it is summer. Since I was little I would see my parents cook and I was actually actively look at it and would also watch youtube video about cooking like the catch and cook videos. The backup idea I had were accounting and fitness.

Some of the articles about fitness and accounting were [how technology is changing the fitness industry today](https://sparkmembership.com/how-technology-is-changing-the-fitness-industry-today) by sparkmemebership, [8 fitness technologies](https://www.bookeeapp.com/articles/8-fitness-technologies) by bookeeapp, and [The Role of Technology In Modern Accounting
](https://online.mason.wm.edu/blog/the-role-of-technology-in-modern-accounting). The links I used to explore cooking was [automate cooking](https://thegadgetflow.com/blog/automate-cooking/), and [The rise of kitchen technology and what to expect in future homes](https://www.hippo.com/blog/future-of-kitchen-technology).

## Engineering Design Process

I am on the Step 1 of EDP (engineering design process) which is defining the problem and the Step 2 of EDP which is researching the problem. At first, we were defining what we are most passionate about. Then, we do more deep research in the field that we are more passionate about and do more research about the technology that is used in that field. For instance, some technologies that were used in the field of cooking are “3D food printing, laser cooking.” I think I'll be on step 2 for a while before I move on to the next step of brainstorming possible solutions.

## Skills

One skill that I learned during this experience is **How to Google**. I say this because in this part of the project, we were able to use Google and do different research for different technologies in different fields of careers. When I searched up cooking all I found were cooking recipes which was rerlated to cooking but it isn't anything close to technlogy. So I added the word tech and automating to my search and that helped me find articles about technology and future techonology in cooking.
