#### Choosing the topic

The topic I decided on is cooking because I been cooking for a few years now and I think it is kind of fun cooking unless it is summer. Since I was little I would see my parents cook and I was actually actively look at it and would also watch youtube video about cooking like the catch and cook videos. The backup idea I had were accounting and fitness.

Some of the articles about fitness and accounting were [how technology is changing the fitness industry today](https://sparkmembership.com/how-technology-is-changing-the-fitness-industry-today) by sparkmemebership, [8 fitness technologies](https://www.bookeeapp.com/articles/8-fitness-technologies) by bookeeapp, and [The Role of Technology In Modern Accounting
](https://online.mason.wm.edu/blog/the-role-of-technology-in-modern-accounting)
